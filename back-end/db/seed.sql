The risk and courage in creating a narrative focused on Gohan, Piccolo, and Pan turn out to be successful due to the more intimate context, but it''s still quite far from the epic levels and supreme satisfaction of the last movie. Exaggerated fan service leads to unjustified, absurd new forms. The pacing and balance of the different storylines and relationships lack better control. The fight sequences have good moments, but some abrupt cuts take away some of the dazzle. And finally, 3D animation proves to be a massive decline in almost every aspect compared to the ideal mix used in recent content. It''s a pleasant, light, fun adventure but sadly unfulfilling.''

The film follows a young girl named Naru (Amber Midthunder) who looks to become a warrior but in a male-dominated setting, only her brother is relatively supportive of her ambition and talks about when she will face a trial which she must endure to show her worth. At the same time, a Predator has arrived and begins to hunt the local wildlife. Naru sees evidence of his work and tries to convince the tribe that the carnage they are finding is not the work of a bear or a mountain lion as the community believes. When the nature of the threat manifests itself, Naru must find the courage and skills to track and face the enemy who threatens to destroy her tribe. The film is directed by Dan Trachtenberg and he mixes a good amount of action along with a very interesting setting and characters to create an engaging tale. There are some moments that the FX was not as sharp as one might expect but the sequences with the Predator are filled with action and suspense and should make fans of the franchise very happy. The film at times does require some leaps of faith from the audience but in the end, “Prey” is a satisfying film that is superior to “The Predator” and rates as one of the stronger entries in the series and that the franchise is in good hands for the future. It will be interesting to see where the franchise goes next as there is lots of material for the franchise to explore, but for now, “Prey” is a refreshing take on the series and one fans should enjoy. 4 stars out of 5', '2022-08-06'),

Dan Trachtenberg is able to restore the franchise by focusing on a compelling protagonist and the motivational essence of the primary creature, as well as creating one of the most dazzling films of 2022. Both the cinematography and the score take advantage of the on-location filmmaking to create an almost epic atmosphere, whether through gorgeous wide shots that will leave every viewer amazed or through violent, macabre, exceptionally choreographed action sequences in conjunction with long takes. Amber Midthunder delivers one of the best performances of her career. For fans of the saga, horror, and/or action, it''s not easy to find something better this year.'' Rating: A-', '2022-08-07'),
('MovieGuys', 766507, 'MovieGuys', null, 'Sometimes it''s best to let the dead rest in peace and such is the case, with the much exhumed, Predator franchise. The original has, quite deservedly,become a cult classic. What came after ranges from passable to truly awful acts of grave robbing. Prey is not awful. It has wonderful cinematic''s and a superficially believable, 18th century world. A world on the cusp of modernisation and change but one that still holds on to, the fading reality embraced by its native inhabitants. Regrettably, that''s far as we get. What comes after is a revisionist construct, that does not reflect life, as it was, in this era. Instead we get feminism, at a time when its presence would have been akin, to finding an automatic wrist watch, in an Egyptian tomb. If by some miracle you can overlook this nonsensical plot turn, it doesn''t get any better. Our hero, a slim young girl, apparently has the wherewithal to take on and defeat, a savage interplanetary killer. A killer, as we can recall from the first film, who chewed through all but one member, of a hardcore team, of special forces mercenaries. Sure, Arnie''s character did use old style tactics, in the end, to defeat the beast. That said, he''s a huge, profoundly physical man, cast as someone with no end of combat training and even then he barely made it out alive. No matter, old world patriarchy defying girl, who has to run like stink from a simple bear the predator easily dispatches, magically gets the job done. Do I need say more? If utter suspension of disbelief is your thing this just might work for you. My advice, watch or re-watch the original and suspend your disbelief that the spin offs that came after, were ever made. 4/10.', '2022-08-14'),
('Per Gunnar Jonsson', 766507, 'Dark Jedi', 'https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cbabaea0fa98692d00130498d7ac5d7c.jpg', 'I guess I have to start by saying that this movie was a lot better than some of the latest entries in the Predator franchise but then, that is not really difficult so it does not say that much. Personally, I think this movie is rather mediocre. Cinematically it is not a bad movie. I liked the footage for the most part. Story wise, well, for the first half of the movie I found it rather boring actually. There was some brief scenes with a wolf and later a bear that had some action in it but for the most part the main protagonist ran around moping and whining and trying to pretend to be worthy of being a great warrior. Somewhat unrealistic of course since Hollywood, of course, had cast a woman in the role. Not that I have anything against it per see but at the time this movie is supposed to happen a women, native Indian or not, stayed at home doing the chores whether Hollywood tries to pretend otherwise or not. As I said, I m still okay with that but she spends most of the time fumbling, stumbling and when a threat comes around she runs and looks scared. Not the kind of great warrior charisma that I was hoping for in the main protagonist. When it finally starts to get interesting she stumbles into a bloody animal trap and gets caught by a hunting party. The latter which of course is portrayed as the typical Hollywood stereotype of “white man bad”. Minor details like, having your foot caught in that kind of steel trap would render you useless for the rest of the movie, is of course ignored. The later half of the movie has some action in it at least which is dragged down by the main protagonists moping and the fact that, when she finally has the chance of taking a shot, she just stares stupidly for half a minute and voila, the chance is gone. On the good side is that the actors are doing a pretty decent job of the not so great script they were given and, as I mentioned, cinematically it is a quite good movie. The action, when it happens, is pretty good if one ignores the Hollywood stupidities and the not so kick-behind main protagonist. Overall the movie is watchable and, as I wrote, better than previous instalments in the franchise but that is about it.', '2022-08-14'),

''Top Gun: Maverick'' is fantastic, simply put. I was expecting it to be good, but it''s actually much more enjoyable than I had anticipated. The callbacks to the original are expertly done, the new characters are strong/well cast, it has plenty of meaning, music is fab and the action is outstanding - the aerial stuff is sensational. The story is superb, with each high stake coming across as intended - parts even gave me slight goosebumps, which is a surprise given I''m not someone who has a connection to the 1986 film. It''s all super neatly put together, I honestly came close to giving it a higher rating. Tom Cruise is brilliant as he reprises the role of Maverick, while Miles Teller comes in and gives a top performance. Jennifer Connelly is another positive, though her role does kinda feel a tiny bit forced in order to have a love interest; given Kelly McGillis'' [unexplained] absence. Monica Barbaro stands out most from the fresh faces, though I actually did enjoy watching them all - which is something I thought the film may struggle with, adding new people, but it''s done nicely; sure Jon Hamm and Glen Powell are a little cliché, though overall I approve. A great watch - I''d highly recommend it, though naturally would suggest watching the previous film first if you haven''t already.', '2022-05-25'),
('tmdb20895531', 361743,'tmdb20895531', null, 'A lot of things in this movie do not make sense, like "why not use F-35?", "why didn''t cruise missiles target enemy air defence and planes in hangars?" to name a few. The original movie had some seriousness built into it, the sequel I think is closer to a comic book movie. Very similar to the original star wars, especially the action sequence at the end. Just a tad more realistic than black widow, you can clearly see the action comedy style of Marvel movies. I think a lot of conservatives reminiscing Reagan years would watch it, that should be enough to make it a hit. I think that is also the reason of the high score. To me the movie quality is more of 5 ~ 7 out of 10. Just don''t think too much when watching it, but I don''t think that is too big a problem for the target audience.', '2022-05-28'),
('CinemaSerf', 361743, 'Geronimo1967', 'https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1kks3YnVkpyQxzw36CObFPvhL5f.jpg', 'It seems like I have been watching the trailers for this film for years now - and you know what? Yes - it was worth the wait. The film is all about some truly exhilarating aerial photography that culminates in some super dogfighting and a good old dose of nostalgia. Tom Cruise is very much in his element as the ageing - and frequently not afraid to look it - eponymous "Top Gun" pilot drafted in by a rather sceptical admiral to train up a new squad for a very perilous mission to destroy an underground uranium enrichment facility. The team arrive - full of hormones - and he must whip them into shape, a task made more difficult by the presence of "Rooster" (Miles Teller) who is the son of his old mate "Goose" who came to a sticky end last time out in 1986. He also gets to rekindle his romance with bar owner "Penny" (Jennifer Connelly) whilst all under the protection of his former wingman, now the poorly retired admiral "Kazansky" (Val Kilmer). To be honest, the story isn''t really up to much - there are some twists and turns, the script is not without some humour but there is no jeopardy really. We all know what is going to happen in the end. That said, though, everyone is on good form; the pace (aside from the interludes with Connelly which do rather abruptly slow things down a bit) is consistently action packed and the imagery from both inside and outside of these amazing pieces of machinery is not at all repetitive and is compelling to watch. Even the usual gung-ho, ye-ha stuff is kept to a minimum - this is a superior film depicting the US military at it''s most competitive, but also at it''s most intelligent - and I really quite enjoyed it. Big screen photography - don''t wait til it is on the telly.', '2022-05-30'),

There''s better acting from the entire cast, more of an emotional attachment between at least two of the main characters in the film, and subtle humor that actually lands. But the film''s constant need to fly in the same flight pattern as the original film comes off as more of a restraint than a fond recollection. The sequel seems to highlight many of the shortcomings of the original film, which in retrospect seems like something you''d try to avoid. With its record breaking box office during Memorial Day weekend, _Top Gun: Maverick_ is an enormously thrilling sequel with unparalleled action sequences that has proven to be exactly what fans have been waiting over 30 years for. **Full review:** https://hubpages.com/entertainment/Top-Gun-Maverick-2022-Review-Dont-Think-Just-Sequel', '2022-06-02'),
('CinemaSerf', 507086, 'Geronimo1967', 'https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1kks3YnVkpyQxzw36CObFPvhL5f.jpg', '''Owen'' (Chris Pratt) and "Claire" (Bryce Dallas Howard) are living in the remote wilderness with "Maisie" (Isabella Sermon), whom they are desperate to protect. From what? Well it turns out she is a bit of a miraculous conception from the "Lockwood" dynasty that co-founded the original park with "Hammond" and is very much on the radar of corporate megalomanic "Dodgson" (Campbell Scott) whose company is devising super-engineered locusts to devour great swathes of crops across the United States that are not grown from their own brand of seed. This is where "Sattler" (Laura Dern) comes in. She is convinced of this dastardly plan, but must compare the DNA of one from his lab with one they secured in the wild so she can prove it. Her plan enlists the help of old pal "Grant" (Sam Neill) and with the help of their intellectual nemesis "Malcolm" (a suitably contrarian effort from Jeff Goldblum) they secure an invitation to the company''s sanctuary in the Italian Dolomites. Meantime, the young girl is abducted from her wintry home, as is the baby of velociraptor "Blue" and so Pratt and Howard have to track them down, and that takes them on some quickly paced, but hardly original, set piece adventures where they meet pilot "Kayla" (DeWanda Wise). She chips in to help them in what now reminded me of aspects of the Brendan Fraser "Mummy" films, before they also end up in the Italian mountains. Can they team up and thwart the cunning plan? The problem with this, is that there are just way too many characters and too many weakly constructed threads to the story going on. It''s all too diffuse and serendipity in the last hour or so just takes far too great a hand in the way the narrative combines and develops. The dinosaur effects are still amazing, but oddly enough I felt them less effective than in previous iterations - there just aren''t enough scenes that feature them and when they do, they are just under-used. Pratt is always good value for me, but here he looks out of sorts and hardly features at all; Scott just doesn''t cut it as the malevolent baddie (though could his character be the same guy who tried to buy the specimens in the first film?) and Sam Neill relies too much on his bemused facial expressions - indeed his best work on this is pretty much all included in the trailers. It looks great on big screen, includes a few bars now and again from John Williams masterful 1993 score, but for the main part this is a pretty mediocre conclusion to a great franchise with an ending that is rushed and entirely predictable.', '2022-06-13'),
('Chris Sawin', 507086, 'ChrisSawin', 'https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf3b87ecb40599290d764e6d73c86319.jpg','With _Jurassic World Dominion_, a _Jurassic World_ film where dinosaurs are now free and interacting with the modern world shouldn''t feel this long-winded or this tiresome. There are a few action sequences that are worthwhile and Jeff Goldblum has a few great one-liners (“You made a promise to a dinosaur?”), but the film is a monumental disappointment overall. The film has already made over $415 million at the worldwide box office, so the interest in the franchise is still there. But the chemistry between the cast is almost non-existent and it feels like the film is running on fumes as it tries to offer something new from what is otherwise dried up fossil fuel. If the _Jurassic Park/Jurassic World_ franchise is to continue, it desperately needs to go in a refreshing and unseen direction. Now that all of the nostalgia is out of the way, fans deserve a refreshing and unique adventure over what is otherwise a glorified rehash. **Full review:** https://hubpages.com/entertainment/Jurassic-World-Dominion-2022-Review-You-Cant-Squeeze-Fun-From-a-Fossil','2022-06-16'),
('Peter McGinn', 507086, 'narrator56', 'https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/tVbrLJzA2RwRlE7dJLJG54UsAkq.jpg', 'So after watching the first four movies in this franchise (three of which I had seen more than once, I finally watched this most recent effort. There are similarities and differences between Dominion and the earlier ones. It held some of the usual elements: a child for us to care when they placed her in danger; the ability of the heroes (even the child) to outrun dinosaurs under a blind panic; walking dinosaur food, also known as bad guys; and references to the original theme park that started it all. They outdid themselves this time - keep an eye out for the Barbasol shaving cream canister. Of course, there are plenty of differences also. Parts of it weren''t even recognizable as part of the franchise. They juggle plot lines around the dinosaurs, the ethics of genetic engineering, a child clone kidnapping, industrial malfeasance, and what for me was the most interesting subplot and most closely tied to the original film: the struggle for humans and dinosaurs to co-exist under the new planetary paradigm. Another difference is that there are two romances developing throughout the film. An improvement is the return of characters we know well: Ellie Sattler and Alan Grant are back, and Ian Malcolm is present long enough to get in a few of his witticisms, unlike in the last movie. So ultimately I found Dominion to be entertaining enough to stick with it, though the aspects that might have been intended to make me think just sort of got in the way.', '2022-08-07');
